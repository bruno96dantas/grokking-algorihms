# Exercises from the Book _"Grokking Algorithms"_ ðŸ“˜

This repository contains solutions to the exercises from the book _"Grokking Algorithms"_ by **Aditya Y. Bhargava**. The goal is to practice and deepen the understanding of algorithms presented in the book by implementing them in **Go (Golang)** and **JavaScript**.

## Purpose

These exercises aim to reinforce fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures, covering topics such as:

- Data search and sorting
- Data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.)
- Graph algorithms
- Optimization algorithms
- Recursion and divide-and-conquer

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: For implementing algorithms with robustness and high performance.
- **JavaScript**: To explore the algorithms in a more dynamic, web-oriented environment.

## Project Structure

Each chapter of the book is organized in a corresponding folder, containing the exercises implemented in both languages (Go and JavaScript).

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ chapter-1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercise-1.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ exercise-1.js
â”œâ”€â”€ chapter-2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercise-2.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ exercise-2.js
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## How to Run

To run the implementations:

### Golang

1. Install [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Navigate to the desired chapter/exercise directory.
3. Run the code with:

   ```bash
   go run exercise-n.go
   ```

### JavaScript

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run the scripts locally.
2. Navigate to the desired chapter/exercise directory.
3. Run the code with:

   ```bash
   node exercise-n.js
   ```

## Contributions

Feel free to suggest improvements or alternative approaches for the implemented algorithms.

This repository will be updated as I progress through the chapters, adding solutions to new exercises.
